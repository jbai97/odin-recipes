        <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>The dish is exclusively made by Soma combined with the 
                Japanese original dish, the Chaliapin Steak and the donburi 
                concept for his first Shokugeki. Although the dish was made 
                with cheap ingredients that can be found in a supermarket, 
                the dish focused on both innovation and balance of the ingredients 
                to fulfill the donburi mantra, <em>"Dons are completed in one bowl."</em></p>

                    <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
                    <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat 
                        tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
                    <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for

                    <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). 
                        Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan 
                        and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. 
                        Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move 
                        the onion to the steak.</li>
                    <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides 
                        of the meat before taking it out.</li>
                    <li>Put rice mixed with Umeboshi paste (pickled plum) in the donburi bowl.

                </ol>

                <ol>
